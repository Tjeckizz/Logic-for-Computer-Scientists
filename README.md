# Logic-for-Computer-Scientists
Labs within the course DD1351

These are the two core labs conducted during this course given during the fall semester 2022 at KTH. 
The lab reports contain information about how the implementations work in detail and provides information I personally would have appreciated being availiable during the course.  
The code and the lab reports provided in this repo is all written by me, and a fellow student, Alexander Wigren (with the exception of eventually given skeleton code from the teacher).

# DO NOT COPY THIS INFORMATION
Rather use this provided documentation to get a more vivid picture of how these labs work and could be implemented if you are taking this course with similiar labs.
